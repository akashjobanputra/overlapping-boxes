# overlapping-boxes

## Currently this repository is for simple use case, where if co-ordinates of two boxes are given we can find out:
- Whether both boxes are overlapping with each other
- If not, what is the distance between their centroids

Looking forward to adding more functionalities and other use cases in future.
